## License - Guidelines for Consumption

**Read this before forking, cloning, or downloading content from this repository.**

This repository encourages the reuse of best practices and software which has been created or obtained by others within IBM. This reuse should reduce the time to create a final solution, but will require clearance work on the part of the user.

**Submissions to these best practices have not been reviewed by legal.**

> Usage of code residing on this repository requires full Certificate of Originality and Open Source Clearance prior to use by the recipient.

Before downloading any assets, **you must certify that you meet the following conditions:**

You hereby certify that YOU:

* Read and understand the [IBM Open Source Participation Guidelines](https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home/wiki/W783ba5fa6c1a_40b3_945a_07d0eb0115bd/page/OSPG) (OSPG) if the asset is subject to ANY open source licenses.

* Will not further distribute downloads from this repository either internally or externally unless I have taken the download through the full Certificate of Originality process appropriate for the use.
* Will delete the Software from non-IBM assets before leaving IBM

With respect to internal distribution, this restriction requires all internal users to download their own copies from this repository in order to track IBM internal users and notify such users if any legal issues arise requiring them to stop use. However, internal automated distribution to test machines is permitted as long as the owner of the test machines assumes the responsibility for taking corrective action for all copies that were part of the automated distribution.

The best practices, code and assets are freely contributed on this repository by an IBM Services community of users and are being made available for evaluation and internal download within IBM Services.  By accessing, downloading and using the best practices, code and assets, you are agreeing not to share or enable use of these assets outside IBM Services. Should you have a need to provide the code to other IBM Services practitioners, or are looking to use it for a client engagement, you may only do so in accordance with the guidelines specified above.
